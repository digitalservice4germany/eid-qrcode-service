# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-06-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

QR Code is embedded in the eService page and it is used to allow user to start identification process via the UseID app camera which later. The QR Code contains `tcTokenURL`, `widgetSessionId` and `encryptionKey`. For this decision record, [ADR 0006](LINK TO 0006) 
```
eid://127.0.0.1:24727/eID-Client?tcTokenURL={{tcTokenURL}}&widgetSessionId={{widgetSessionId}}&mobile={{isMobileDevice}}#{{encryptionKey}}
```
The current QR Code generation is handled in the server `/v1/qrcode/{imageSize}`

## Decision

In order to improve the security measures, QR Code should be handled on the client side.
1. eService provides the necessary information  `tcTokenURL`, `widgetSessionId` and `encryptionKey`
2. Widget provides the eService with QR Code library

## Consequences
1. Increase load time
2. UseID Backend will not have any knowledge of `tcTokenUrl`
